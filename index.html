        <p class="bio-name">Pacific Rim is the best movie that has ever been made in our life time.<br>The storyline of the show is what I consider peak fiction. The amount of action <br>between the kaijus and the jeagers is incredible. Character development <br>is perfect for the story. The tradedy is very realistic in correlation to the storyline.<br> This is the best movie ever.</p>

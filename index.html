        <h1 class="hidden">Pacific Rim</h1>      
        <p class="bio-name">Pacific Rim is the best movie that has ever been made in our life time.<br>The storyline of the show is what I consider peak fiction. The amount of action <br>between the kaijus and the jeagers is incredible. Character development <br>is perfect for the story. The tradedy is very realistic in correlation to the storyline.<br> This is the best movie ever.</p>

        <h1 class="hidden">Now You See Me</h1>
        <p class="bio-name">Pacific rim is definitly not the best movie that has ever benn made. For example Now You See Me<br> stomps Pacific Rim in the ground based on storyline alone. The individual acting from everyone is<br> many levels higher than the acting in Pacific Rim. Now You See Me also has a better way of<br> grabbing and holding onto the viewers attention since the pace of the story is consistently interesting.<br> Each performance by the magicians unique and breathtaking. Overall way better than Pacific Rim.</p>
